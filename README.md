Below is the Python code for an AI-powered education platform with key features:
Python Backend Code for AI-Driven Education Platform
1. Setup Project Structure

Here’s a basic project structure to help you organize the development process:

/education-platform
    /frontend
        - React.js (or another frontend framework)
    /backend
        /app
            - __init__.py
            - models.py
            - routes.py
            - utils.py
        - requirements.txt
    /data
        - coursework_data.csv
    /migrations

2. Install Required Libraries

To install the necessary Python libraries, you will need the following:

pip install flask psycopg2-binary spaCy nltk scikit-learn

    Flask: For the backend API.
    psycopg2: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
    spaCy & NLTK: For text processing and NLP.
    scikit-learn: For building recommendation systems and automating grading.

3. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Create a PostgreSQL database with tables for users, courses, assessments, and grades.

CREATE DATABASE education_platform;

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- "student", "teacher", "admin"
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Courses Table
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Assessments Table
CREATE TABLE assessments (
    assessment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id),
    title VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User-Course Enrollment Table
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id),
    enrollment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Grades Table
CREATE TABLE grades (
    grade_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    assessment_id INT REFERENCES assessments(assessment_id),
    score FLOAT,
    grade VARCHAR(5),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

4. Backend Code (Flask Application)
app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
import psycopg2
import spacy
import nltk
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

app = Flask(__name__)

# Connect to PostgreSQL database
def get_db_connection():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname="education_platform", user="your_user", password="your_password", host="localhost"
    )
    return conn

# Initialize SpaCy and NLTK
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nltk.download("stopwords")

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return jsonify({"message": "Welcome to the AI-Driven Education Platform!"})

@app.route('/get_courses', methods=['GET'])
def get_courses():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM courses;")
    courses = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return jsonify(courses)

@app.route('/enroll_course', methods=['POST'])
def enroll_course():
    data = request.json
    user_id = data['user_id']
    course_id = data['course_id']
    
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO enrollments (user_id, course_id) VALUES (%s, %s)", (user_id, course_id))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Enrolled successfully!"})

@app.route('/personalized_recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def personalized_recommendations():
    # For simplicity, return dummy recommendations
    return jsonify({
        "recommendations": [
            {"course_id": 1, "course_name": "Data Science 101"},
            {"course_id": 2, "course_name": "Machine Learning Basics"}
        ]
    })

@app.route('/grade_assessment', methods=['POST'])
def grade_assessment():
    data = request.json
    user_id = data['user_id']
    assessment_id = data['assessment_id']
    answers = data['answers']  # Assume it's a list of answers
    
    # Simulating grading logic with NLP (using a simple model here for demonstration)
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))
    answers_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(answers)
    
    model = LogisticRegression()  # Simple model for grading (real implementation should be more complex)
    model.fit(answers_vectorized, [0, 1])  # Dummy labels (0 for incorrect, 1 for correct)
    
    score = model.score(answers_vectorized, [0, 1])  # Grading logic
    grade = "A" if score > 0.8 else "B"
    
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO grades (user_id, assessment_id, score, grade) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)", 
                   (user_id, assessment_id, score, grade))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    
    return jsonify({"score": score, "grade": grade})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

5. Frontend (ReactJS)

You can build the ReactJS frontend for user dashboards, course enrollment, and viewing personalized recommendations. For example, you can create components like:

    Dashboard Component: Display user details, courses enrolled, and progress.
    Course Enrollment Component: Allow students to view and enroll in courses.
    Personalized Recommendations Component: Display recommended courses based on user activity and preferences.

You can use Axios to communicate with the Flask backend:

import axios from 'axios';

const getCourses = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/get_courses');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("There was an error fetching the courses!", error);
  }
};

6. AI Integration for Personalization

In the backend, the personalized_recommendations endpoint provides AI-based course suggestions. You can enhance this feature by integrating more advanced models for personalized learning paths.

For instance, use K-Means clustering or Collaborative Filtering for personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
Deployment and Maintenance

    Cloud Hosting: Deploy the backend using AWS EC2 or Google Cloud.
    Monitoring: Use Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring system health.
    Security: Make sure to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure data access.

Final Thoughts

This Python code provides the backend logic for creating a foundational AI-driven education platform. The platform uses NLP for personalized recommendations and automated grading. Frontend and deployment work should follow to complete the project.
